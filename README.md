## Getting Started

* Verify that it's not been posted before.

You can search the bugtracker for keywords in order to verify that the issue you're posting wasn't already reported. Please do so to avoid creating work for the team.
A closed report means only one thing – the devs consider the report either to be fixed or false. If you have something to say about a closed report, comment on it, we'll take a look and reopen it if needed.

* One issue per ticket

Only report one issue per ticket as multiple issues within one ticket is harder to track and harder to address.

* Supply as much evidence as possible.

This depends upon the type of bug but generally make it clear enough for the team to reporduce the bug or know what you are talking about. Better too much info than too little.

* Do not bump issues.

The bugtracker is not a forum in which old threads get buried by the new ones – we regularly look through all reports, both old and new. 

* If contradicted by the devs, don't press the point.

If a developer asserts that a certain feature of the mod is working as intended, and you happen to disagree, please acquire more proof which demonstrates that there is indeed an issue before posting in the topic again.

* Ensure you can use English to a respectable standard. 

Google Translate reports will be closed.
